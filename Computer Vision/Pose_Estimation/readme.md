I did this project to help Tencent to create some educational football tutorials. As a data scientist, I’ve applied one of the most useful tools, OpenCV, in the process. By using OpenCV, people can track the coach’s pose and hands positions, so that they can throw or catch the football correctly when they start learning how to play football. his one-minute-long video is a demo of my work.

Software used: Python, Pycharm, Git, Adobe Premiere.
